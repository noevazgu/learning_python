# A literal is data whose values are determined by the literal itself.

# example:
print(24) # 24 represents itself, it's the number 24
#print(c) # we cannot be sure what is c, t may represent a lot of things, not a string because it has not double/single quotes
# line above is commented because it has an error since Python do not know what c is


# there are more literals:
# string literals:
print("20", "hello") # "20" and "hello" are string literals, "20" is no longer a number is a string, it means you cannot do math with it, it represents two characters not the number 20

# bool literals
print(True, False) # these are two values that are used for comparations
