# scientific notation numbAx10^numbB, example: 2x10^4 = 20000
# in python:
print(2e4) # print converts scientific notation to decimal

# ALSOOOO, note that scientific notation creates a FLOAT number
# also you can use upper E
# also you can use negative numbers:
print(2E-4)

# Also the exponent (numbB) needs to be an integer
# base (numbA) MAY be an integer
