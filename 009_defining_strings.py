# strings can be defined using double quotes or single quotes

# ALSO you can use triple double quotes:
print("""hello
world my
name
     is noe""")
# as you can see triple double quotes preserver new lines
print("let's try \
with this \
so you \
can see")
# I used a back slash at the end to tell python I am continuing the string in the line below, it is not a escape character
