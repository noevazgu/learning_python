# variable are chunk of memory that we can use to store values and then use the name of the varaible to retrieve the value:

name_of_the_variable = "my value"
another_variable = 24

print("check this are the values, I jsut need to use the name of the varaibles:", name_of_the_variable, another_variables)
print("I can also do math if the value is a number:", another_variable/2)

# it is recommended to use a significative name:

age = 24
year = 2020
last_name = "Vazquez"

# Variable names cannot start with a number
# Also , Python lets you use not only Latin letters but also characters specific to languages that use other alphabets, welcome Ã‘

# The PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code recommends the following naming convention for variables and functions in Python:

#    variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores to improve readability (e.g., var, my_variable)
#    function names follow the same convention as variable names (e.g., fun, my_function)
#    it's also possible to use mixed case (e.g., myVariable), but only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style, to retain backwards compatibility with the adopted convention.
